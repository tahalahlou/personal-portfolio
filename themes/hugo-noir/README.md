## Installation

Ensure you have Hugo installed (Extended version, v0.92.0 or newer is recommended).

For a quick start and to see a full configuration example, you can refer to the `hugo.example.toml` file included in the theme's root directory. You can copy this file to your site's root as `hugo.toml` (or `config.toml`) and customize it.

### Option 1: Clone Repository (Recommended for theme development)

```bash
# From your Hugo site's root directory
git clone https://github.com/prxshetty/hugo-noir.git themes/hugo-noir
```

### Option 2: Add as a Git Submodule (Recommended for using the theme in your project)

```bash
# From your Hugo site's root directory
git submodule add https://github.com/prxshetty/hugo-noir.git themes/hugo-noir
```
Then, update your submodules:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Configuration

1.  **Set the theme in your site's `hugo.toml` (or `config.toml`):**

    ```toml
    theme = "hugo-noir"
    ```

2.  **Hugo Version Compatibility:**

    This theme requires:
    *   Hugo **Extended** version.
    *   Minimum version: **0.92.0** (recommended).

    To ensure compatibility, especially if you plan to submit this theme to the Hugo Themes showcase, you can specify Hugo version requirements within the theme's own `hugo.toml` or `config.toml` (create one at `themes/hugo-noir/hugo.toml` if it doesn't exist) or more commonly in a `theme.toml` file at the root of the theme.

    Example for `themes/hugo-noir/theme.toml` (see "Theme Metadata" section below):
    ```toml
    [module]
      [module.hugoVersion]
        extended = true
        min = "0.92.0"
        # max = "0.1xx.x" # Optionally specify a max version
    ```

3.  **Multilingual Setup (Optional):**

    This theme is pre-configured for English (en), Spanish (es), and French (fr). To enable multilingual mode in your site, configure your main `hugo.toml` like this:

    ```toml
    defaultContentLanguage = "en"
    defaultContentLanguageInSubdir = true # Recommended for clearer URLs like /en/blog, /es/blog

    [languages]
      [languages.en]
        languageName = "English"
        title = "Your Site Title (English)"
        weight = 1
        contentDir = "content/en" # Ensure you have this directory
        [languages.en.menu]
          [[languages.en.menu.main]]
            name = "About"
            pageRef = "/about"
            weight = 1
          # ... other English menu items
      [languages.es]
        languageName = "Espa√±ol"
        title = "Your Site Title (Spanish)"
        weight = 2
        contentDir = "content/es" # Ensure you have this directory
        [languages.es.menu]
          [[languages.es.menu.main]]
            name = "Sobre M√≠" # Translated name
            pageRef = "/about" # pageRef should ideally point to the same logical page
            weight = 1
          # ... other Spanish menu items
      [languages.fr]
        languageName = "Fran√ßais"
        title = "Your Site Title (French)"
        weight = 3
        contentDir = "content/fr" # Ensure you have this directory
        [languages.fr.menu]
          [[languages.fr.menu.main]]
            name = "√Ä Propos" # Translated name
            pageRef = "/about"
            weight = 1
          # ... other French menu items

    # Remember to create content in the respective contentDir folders (e.g., content/en/about.md, content/es/about.md)
    ```
    The theme's `i18n` folder (`themes/hugo-noir/i18n/`) contains the translation strings.

4.  **Params for `hugo.toml` (and Data Files):**

    The theme uses parameters from your site's `hugo.toml` under `[params]` for common information like your name and social links. Ensure these are set. Example:
    ```toml
    [params]
      name = "Your Name"
      location = "Your Location"
      description = "Description ..."
      profile_image = "/images/your-profile.jpg" # Place in your site's static/images/
      # Social links
      github = "https://github.com/yourusername"
      twitter = "https://twitter.com/yourusername"
      linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
      email = "your.email@example.com"
      # ... other params ...
    ```

    **Site-Specific Data (Author, Experience, etc.):**

    For language-specific information like author details and your professional experience, this theme utilizes Hugo's data files. You should create these in your site's `data` directory, typically organized by language.

    *   **Author Information:** Create files like `data/en/author.toml`, `data/es/author.toml`. Example for `data/en/author.toml`:
        ```toml
        [author]
          name = "Your Name"
          location = "Your Location"
          description = "Description ..."
          profile_image = "/images/your-profile.jpg" # Place in your site's static/images/
          # Social links
          github = "https://github.com/yourusername"
          twitter = "https://twitter.com/yourusername"
          linkedin = "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername"
          email = "your.email@example.com"
          # ... other social links ...
        ```

    *   **Experience Data:** The "Experience" section on your site (using the `experience.html` layout) is populated from a data file. Create a file such as `data/en/experience.toml` (or `.yaml`/`.json`). Each entry should detail a role or position.

        Example structure for an entry in `data/en/experience.toml`:
        ```toml
        [[experience]]
          role = "Senior Developer"
          company = "Tech Solutions Inc."
          company_link = "https://www.techsolutions.com" # Add company URL here
          period = "Jan 2020 - Present"
          country = "USA" # New field for region/country
          # description = "Longer description of the role..." # Optional detailed description
          responsibilities = [
            "Developed and maintained web applications.",
            "Collaborated with cross-functional teams.",
            "Led junior developers."
          ]
          technologies = ["Go", "Docker", "Kubernetes", "React"]
        
        [[experience]]
          role = "Software Engineer"
          company = "Innovate LLC"
          # company_link = "" # Omit or leave blank if no link
          period = "Jun 2018 - Dec 2019"
          country = "Canada"
          responsibilities = [
            "Contributed to full-stack development projects.",
            "Participated in code reviews and agile sprints."
          ]
          technologies = ["Python", "Django", "PostgreSQL"]
        ```
        Ensure you have a similar file for each language you support (e.g., `data/es/experience.toml`). The `experience.html` layout in the theme will automatically pick up the data for the current language.

        **Adding Company Links:**
        This site supports displaying clickable links for companies in the "Experience" section.
        - To add a link, include the `company_link` field with the URL in the respective experience entry within your `data/<language_code>/experience.yaml` (or `.json`/`.toml`) file. For example, you would update `data/en/experience.yaml`, `data/es/experience.yaml`, and `data/fr/experience.yaml` if you support English, Spanish, and French respectively.
        - If a `company_link` is provided, the company name will be a hyperlink. Otherwise, it will be plain text.
        - Styling: Links match the site's theme (grey, turning blue on hover). An external link icon is automatically added.
        - No template changes are needed; the layouts already support this.
        Remember to replace `<language_code>` with the actual language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `fr`).

## Content Structure

The theme generally expects a standard Hugo content structure. For multilingual sites, organize content into language-specific subdirectories as defined in your `hugo.toml`'s `contentDir` for each language.

Example:
```
content/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en/                 # English content
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md       # Homepage content for English
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blogs/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ my-first-blog.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ projects/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-a.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ es/                 # Spanish content
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md       # Homepage content for Spanish
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blogs/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mi-primer-blog.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fr/                 # French content
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md       # Homepage content for French
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ blogs/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _index.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mon-premier-blog.md
```

## Front Matter Examples

### Blog Post

```yaml
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2023-03-15T10:30:00+05:30 # Or your local timezone
draft: false
tags: ["hugo", "web development"]
categories: ["tutorials"]
description: "A brief description of your post for SEO and previews."
# For multilingual posts, ensure the filename is the same across languages
# e.g., content/en/blogs/my-post.md and content/es/blogs/my-post.md
# Hugo will link them as translations.
---

Your post content here...
```

### Static Page (e.g., About, Contact)

```yaml
---
title: "About Me"
date: 2023-03-15T10:30:00+05:30
draft: false
menu: "main" # Optional: if you want it to appear in the main menu configured in hugo.toml
layout: "single" # Or specific layout if defined
description: "A brief description of the page."
---

Page content here...
```

## Customization

You can customize the theme:

-   **Override Templates:** Copy any template file from `themes/hugo-noir/layouts/` into your site's `layouts/` directory (maintaining the same subdirectory structure) and modify it.
-   **Custom CSS:**
    -   For minor CSS overrides, you can create `assets/css/custom.css` in your site's root. The theme will attempt to load this.
    -   For more extensive changes, you might want to fork the theme or modify its Tailwind CSS configuration (`themes/hugo-noir/tailwind.config.js`) and rebuild the theme's CSS.
-   **Static Assets:** Place your own static assets (images, fonts) in your site's `static/` directory.
-   **Partials:** Override or extend partials found in `themes/hugo-noir/layouts/partials/` by creating files with the same name in your site's `layouts/partials/` directory.

## Theme Metadata (`theme.toml`) (for Hugo Themes Showcase)

For submission to themes.gohugo.io, your theme needs a `theme.toml` file in its root directory (`themes/hugo-noir/theme.toml`).

Example `themes/hugo-noir/theme.toml`:
```toml
name = "Hugo Noir"
license = "MIT" # Or your chosen license
licenselink = "https://github.com/prxshetty/hugo-noir/blob/main/LICENSE" # Link to the theme's license file
description = "A clean, minimalistic, and multilingual theme for Hugo, focusing on readability and simplicity. Built with Tailwind CSS and offering dark mode."
version = "2.0.0" # Theme version

homepage = "https://github.com/prxshetty/hugo-noir/" # Theme's source repository
demosite = "" # URL to a live demo of your theme

tags = ["blog", "minimal", "responsive", "dark mode", "tailwind", "multilingual", "personal", "portfolio"]
features = ["dark mode", "multilingual", "tailwind css", "responsive", "contact form", "devicons"] # Key features

[author]
  name = "John Doe" # Your name
  homepage = "https://johndoe.com" # Your website

# If porting from another theme, add [original] section
# [original]
#   author = "Original Author Name"
#   homepage = "Link to original theme's homepage"
#   repo = "Link to original theme's repository"

[module]
  [module.hugoVersion]
    extended = true
    min = "0.92.0"
```
