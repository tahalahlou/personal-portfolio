**Hi, I'm Taha**

I like building things that make life easier (or at least less annoying). Lately, that’s meant developing AI workflows to automate repetitive tasks so I can focus on more creative projects. I’m a CS student at Columbia, and a lot of what I’ve learned has come from online resources and experimenting with technologies I find interesting. I also care about giving back to my community: I mentor through Columbia’s Mentoring Initiative (CMI) and facilitate peer-led workshops in the Columbia Emerging Scholars Program, helping students navigate intro to CS classes, internships, and college life. Much of my recognition has come from volunteering, including the President’s Lifetime Achievement Award and the Congressional Award Gold Medal.
